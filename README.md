# Overview

DevOps is the practice of developing software that integrates software development and IT operations to deliver software faster and ensure continuous delivery with high quality. However, security often becomes an afterthought when designing and managing a CI/CD pipeline, infrastructure, etc., for deploying large-scale applications. Therefore, it is important to incorporate security in every step of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). DevSecOps is the practice of automating security throughout the SDLC by combining development, operations, and security into a single pipeline.

In this project, we will build a complete CI/CD pipeline for a microservice application as most large-scale software follows microservice architecture nowadays. More importantly, we will include several security tools that can conduct security scans at various stages of the pipeline. Finally, we will setup monitoring and notification services.

- MySQL

### Security Tools

In this project we used several popular security tools such as `PHPStan`, `SonarQube`, `OWASP Dependency-Check`, `Trivy` and `OWASP ZAP`. Let's briefly discuss each of them.

**PHPStan**

PHPStan is a static analysis system for PHP projects. It scans your entire codebase and looks for both obvious and tricky bugs, even in rarely executed if statements that aren’t covered by tests. It can be run on your machine and in CI to prevent bugs from reaching your customers in production. PHPStan is open-source, free, and offers extensions for popular frameworks like Symfony, Laravel, or Doctrine. It also understands code that takes advantage of magic methods and properties.

**Sonarqube**

SonarQube is an open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality and security. SonarQube identifies code smells, bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code duplications in your source code. It supports a large number of programming languages, including Java, C/C++, Python, JavaScript, and more. SonarQube can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate code quality and security checks at various stages of development. It generates detailed reports and provides a dashboard for visualizing code quality and security issues. SonarQube is used by development teams to maintain and improve the overall quality and security of their codebases. It helps identify and fix issues early in the development process, reducing technical debt and the risk of security vulnerabilities.

**OWASP Dependency Check**

OWASP Dependency Check is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool that detects publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within a project’s dependencies. It does this by determining if there is a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier for a given dependency. If found, it generates a report linking to the associated CVE entries. Dependency Check can be used to scan applications (and their dependent libraries) to identify any known vulnerable components. It helps address the problem of using known vulnerable components in applications, which can pose security risks.

**Trivy**

Trivy is an open-source vulnerability scanner designed specifically for containerized applications. It focuses on scanning container images and filesystems for security vulnerabilities.Trivy can scan Docker containers and OCI (Open Container Initiative) images.It maintains a comprehensive database of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) to identify known vulnerabilities.Trivy is known for its speed and simplicity, making it easy to integrate into CI/CD pipelines.Trivy is typically used by DevOps and security teams to ensure the security of containerized applications by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in container images. It is often integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate security checks during the build and deployment process.

**OWASP ZAP**

OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is the world’s most widely used web app scanner. It is a free and open-source tool actively maintained by a dedicated international team of volunteers. ZAP helps identify security vulnerabilities in web applications by scanning them for potential weaknesses. It provides a range of options for security automation and has add-ons contributed by the community to extend its functionality.

# Prerequisites

Before we can build a pipeline to deploy our application we need to prepare several things. These include Installing required tools, EKS and RDS cluster provisioning for our deployment environment and creating IAM roles for building the pipeline.

## EC2 Instance

**Step 1:** Go to EC2 > Click on "Launch Instance".

**Step 2:**  Give a name and select the OS image (e.g, Ubuntu)

**Step 3:** Select the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) -->(free tier eligible)

**Step 4:** Choose the Instance type accoridng to your project requirements(Used t2.medium for this project)

**Step 5:** Click on "Create a new Key Pair" to securely connect to your instance. Ensure that you have access to the selected key pair before you launch the instance.

**Step 6:** Select the VPC, Subnet and Auto-assign public IP or you can choose default configurations.

**Step 7:** Create a security group and allow some required ports (e.g, port:22, port:8000 and port:9000)

**Step 8:** Finally, launch the instance.

## AWS CLI setup

For various tasks in this project we will need to interact with AWS services and resources from our local machine. Therefore, we need to install AWS CLI and configure it properly in our system. Follow the steps below for installing and configuring the AWS CLI.

> **Note:** If you are using an EC2 instance with Amazon linux images aws cli should already be installed in the system. In that case, skip the installations steps.

**Step 1:**  Make sure `curl` and `unzip` is installed in the system.

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install -y curl unzip
```

**For RHEL:**

```bash
sudo yum install -y curl unzip
```

**Step 2:** Download the install script for aws-cli

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
```

**Step 3:** Unzip and run the install script.

```bash
unzip awscliv2.zip

sudo ./aws/install
```

**Step 4:** Run the following command to check the version of installed aws cli:

```bash
aws --version
```

**Step 5:** Run the following command to start configuring AWS CLI.

```bash
aws configure
```

**Step 6:** For configuring the aws cli you will need an Access key and Secret access key pair associated with your account. If you don't have an access key, login to your aws account and go to security credentials.

![aws-security-credentials.png](assets/aws-security-credentials.png)

![](assets/account-access-key.png)

Create an access key for aws command line interface. Download the access key after generation and save it in a safe place because the secret key can't be obtained later.

**Step 7:** Use the access key and secret access key to configure the AWS CLI. The configuration should look like the image below.

![aws-cli-configuration.png](assets/aws-cli-configuration.png)

## Kubectl setup

To interact with the EKS cluster we will need `kubectl`. Follow the steps below:

**Step 1:** Run the following command to download kubectl binary.

```bash
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
```

**Step 2:**  Afterwards, run the following command to install kubectl as the root user.

```bash
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

**Step 3:** Check `kubectl` is working by running a version check

```bash
kubectl version --client
```

## Terraform Setup

We need terraform to setup an EKS and RDS cluster for this project. Follow the steps below to setup terraform:

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**

**Step 1:** Install  `gnupg`, `software-properties-common`, and `curl` packages by running the following commands.

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common
```

**Step 2:**  Install HashiCorp GPG Key

```bash
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \

gpg --dearmor | \

sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
```

**Step 3:** Add the HashiCorp repository to your package manager.

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] \

https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | \

sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
```

**Step 4:** Update packages and install Terraform.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install terraform
```

**For RHEL:**

**Step 1:** Install `yum-utils` package.

```bash
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
```

**Step 2:** Use `yum-config-manager` to add HashiCorp repository to your package manager.

```bash
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo`
```

**Step 3:** Finally, install terraform from the newly added repository

```bash
sudo yum -y install terraform
```

## EKS and RDS Cluster Provisioning with Terraform

Assuming you have already installed and setup `terraform`, `aws-cli` & `kubectl` we can provision the EKS and RDS Cluster using the provided terraform code.

**Step 1:** Clone the terraform code repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/umme-habiba786/devsecops-aws-cloud.git
```

**Step 2:** Go to `terraform` directory and open and edit `variables.tf` file. Change the region to your current one.

**Step 3:** Next, run the following command to intiate the backend.

```bash
terraform init
```

**Step 4:** Next, run the following command to generate a plan before provisioning

```bash
terraform plan
```

**Step 5:** Thoroughly check the plan and run the following command to apply and start the provisioning process.

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

**Step 6:** After provisioning is completed. you should see the cluster name and region. Now, we need to get the `kubeconfig` file to communicate with the EKS control-plane. We can do so with the help of `aws-cli`. Run the following command to update the kubeconfig file.

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <eks-cluster-name> --region <aws-region-name>
```

**Step 7:** Check if the `kubectl` can communicate with the cluster by running the following coommand:

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```

**Step 8:** Create a namespace where all our deployment would reside by running the following command

```bash
kubectl create namespace vaccination-system-dev
```

**Step 9:** We can check cluster is functioning properly by going to the `AWS Console` `>` `Elastic Kuberntetes Service` `>` `Clusters`.

![vaccination-system-eks-Clusters-EKS.png](assets/vaccination-system-eks-Clusters-EKS.png)

**Step 10:** Head over to `RDS` > `Databases` and there should be a RDS instance with the name `vaccination-rds`. Make note or copy the RDS endpoint address which will be needed in the later steps.

**Step 11:** Next, create an EC2 instance inside the same VPC as the EKS cluster. The VPC name should be `vaccination-vpc` which is created with terraform. Make sure to choose a public subnet to launch the EC2 as well. Use `Amazon Linux 2023` image.

**Step 12:** Connect to the EC2 and execute the following command to install `mariadb-server`

```bash
sudo yum install -y mariadb105-server
```

**Step 13:** After the installation, connect to the database
Make sure the replace the `rds-hostname` with the RDS endpoint previously found in **Step 9**.

```bash
mysql -h <rds-hostname> -u root --password='12345678'
```

**Step 14:** Next, run the following MySQL queries that will create two databases and create a new user named 'vms-user' grant access to the new databases;

```sql
-- Run as MySQL Root user

CREATE DATABASE registration;
CREATE DATABASE appointment;

CREATE USER 'vms-user' IDENTIFIED BY 'vms-password';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON registration.* to 'vms-user';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON appointment.* to 'vms-user';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

**Step 15:(Optional)** Make sure to change the root password to a new one as the default password set for the root user is not secure. Replace `<new-password>` with a strong password in the command below.

```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<new-password>'; 
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### EKS-auth ConfigMap

**Step 1:** First, you need to get the `kubeconfig` file to communicate with the EKS control-plane. We can do so with the help of `aws-cli`. Run the following command to update the kubeconfig file. (Follow this step, if you haven't done this in Kubectl Setup before)

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <eks-cluster-name> --region <aws-region-name>
```

**Step 2:** Copy and Paste this command in AWS Cli. Replace the 72101xxxxxxx with your Account ID and Vaccination-CodeBuildServiceRole with you newly created CodeBuild Service Role name.

```bash
ROLE="    - rolearn: arn:aws:iam::72101xxxxxxx:role/Vaccination-CodeBuildServiceRole\n      username: build\n      groups:\n        - system:masters"
```

**Step 2:** Update the auth configmap with new configuration in your AWS Cli setup.

```
kubectl get -n kube-system configmap/aws-auth -o yaml | awk "/mapRoles: \|/{print;print \"$ROLE\";next}1" > /tmp/aws-auth-patch.yml

kubectl patch configmap/aws-auth -n kube-system --patch "$(cat /tmp/aws-auth-patch.yml)"
```

## ECR (Elastic Container Registry) Setup

**Step 1:** Go over to ECR and create a private repository with a name of your choosing.

![Elastic-Container-Registry-Create-Repository.png](./assets/Elastic-Container-Registry-Create-Repository.png)

**Step 2:** Next, go to Permissions>Edit JSON Policy and delete the default and set the following permissions for the repository

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "ecr:BatchGetImage",
        "ecr:DescribeImages",
        "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
        "ecr:PullImage"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## S3 Bucket Configuration

**Step 1:** Go over to S3 and create a private bucket for the project. Check if the settings matches the following screenshots and keep the defaults for rest of the configurations.

![](./assets/S3-bucket-1.png)

![](./assets/S3-bucket-2.png)

![](./assets/S3-bucket-3.png)

## Security Scan Logs collection with AWS Lambda

**Step 1:** First, create a lambda function named `ImportVulToSecurityHub`. Setting the name to the aforementioned value is crucial because inside each security tools scan buildspec file we will be invoking the function by name.

![](assets/Create-function-Lambda.png)

**Step 2:** Set `Python 3.9` as the runtime and `x86_64` as the architechture.

![](assets/Create-function-Lambda-1.png)

**Step 3:** Next, make sure that a new role is created along with the function

![](assets/Create-function-Lambda-2.png)

**Step 4:** Modify the new Lambda role and add `AmazonS3FullAccess` and `AWSSecurityHubFullAccess` policies.

![](assets/Create-function-Lambda-3.png)

**Step 5:** Go into the lambda function you just created and click on **Upload From** and choose **.zip file** option.

![](assets/Create-function-Lambda-4.png)

This should import the codes into two files one named `lambda_function.py` and another `securityhub.py`

* You can find the lambda function files in the github repository.

**Step 6:** Go over to **Configuration** and then **Environment Variables** and add a new variable with the key `BUCKET_NAME` and value set to the S3 bucket you choose to store your scan logs to. See the image below for reference.

![](assets/Create-function-Lambda-5.png)

**Step 7:** Finally, Deploy the function

## Security Hub

**Step 1:** Go to security hub > Click on  the button "Go to Security Hub"

![](assets/Security-Hub.png)

**Step 2:** Then, click on "Enable Security Hub" to connect the security hub with lambda.

![](assets/Security-Hub-enable.png)

sudo useradd -c "user to run SonarQube" -d /opt/sonarqube -g sonar sonar

sudo chown sonar:sonar /opt/sonarqube -R
```

**Step 10:** Modify sonar.properties file

```bash
sudo vi /opt/sonarqube/conf/sonar.properties
```

* Uncomment the below lines by removing # and add values highlighted yellow

```bash
sonar.jdbc.username=sonar

sonar.jdbc.password=password
```

* Next, uncomment the below line, removing #

```bash
sonar.jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/sonarqube
```

(Press escape, and enter :wq! to come out of the above screen).

Edit the sonar script file and set RUN_AS_USER

```bash
sudo vi /opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64/sonar.sh
```

**Step 11:** Add enable the below line

```bash
RUN_AS_USER=sonar
```

**Step 12:** Create Sonar as a service(this will enable to start automatically when you restart the server)

* Execute the below command:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/sonar.service
```

* Add the below code in green color:

```bash
[Unit]

Description=SonarQube service

After=syslog.target network.target



[Service]

Type=forking



ExecStart=/opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64/sonar.sh start

ExecStop=/opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64/sonar.sh stop



User=sonar

Group=sonar

Restart=always



[Install]

WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Step 13:** Now, start the servcie

```bash
sudo systemctl start sonar



sudo systemctl enable sonar



sudo systemctl status sonar
```

**Step 14:**  (Now Restart EC2 instance by going to AWS console and stop/start the EC2 instance)  

* Once restarted EC2 instance, login again and check the Sonar logs:  

```bash
tail -f /opt/sonarqube/logs/sonar.log
```

* Make sure you get the below message that says sonarqube is up..

**Step 15:** Login to SonarQube server with Instance's IP Address and Port Number 9000 (SonarQube's port number)

```bash
Login Username: Admin

Login Password: Admin
```

# Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

**Step 1:** Install `Helm3` in the system

```bash
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3

chmod 700 get_helm.sh

./get_helm.sh
```

**Step 2:** Next, install the `prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack` helm chart by running the following command(Assuming you have `kubectl` and kubeconfig configured). This will install a complete monitoring stack that includes `Prometheus`, `Grafana`, `Alertmanager`, `Node Exporter`, `Kube State Metrics` and `Prometheus Operator`.

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

helm install kube-prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -n prometheus --create-namespace
```

**Step 3:** Afterwards, check all the monitoring pods are up and running.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n prometheus
```

**Step 5:** Now by default the services that serves as the endpoint to the tools are defined as `ClusterIP` services. If we wnat to access them we need to perform port forwarding in order to access them.

```bash
nohup kubectl port-forward -n prometheus svc/kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus 85:9090 --address 0.0.0.0 &>/dev/null &

nohup kubectl port-forward -n prometheus svc/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana 86:80 --address 0.0.0.0 &>/dev/null &

nohup kubectl port-forward -n prometheus svc/kube-prometheus-stack-alertmanager 87:9093 --address 0.0.0.0 &>/dev/null &
```

**Step 6:** If the commands in the above step executed properly, we can view `Prometheus` at ['http://localhost:85'](http://localhost:85), `Grafana` at ['http://localhost:86'](http://localhost:86) and `AlertManager` at ['http://localhost:87'](http://localhost:87).

**Step 7:** Once all the pods are ready and running without any errors and the services are accessible, we can start applying our prometheus configurations. Go to the `prometheus` folder and apply each configurations.

```bash
kubectl apply -f PrometheusRule.yaml

kubectl apply -f AlertmanagerSecret.yaml
```

**Step 8:** Finally, perform a restart on the prometheus and alertmanager instances so that they get the updated configuration quickly.

```bash
kubectl -n prometheus rollout restart statefulset prometheus-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus alertmanager-kube-prometheus-stack-alertmanager
```

# Autoscaling with metrics server

**Step 1:** Since we have defined a `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` for all of our deployments, it needs a metrics API endpoint to scale up/down depending on the metrics. We need to install the `metrics-server` in the same namespace as our deployments. Run the command below to install the `metrics-server` using helm.

```bash
helm repo add metrics-server https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/metrics-server/

helm install metrics-server metrics-server/metrics-server -n prometheus
```
